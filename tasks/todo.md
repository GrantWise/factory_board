Of course. Here's a cleaned-up and summarized version of your file.

### **Project Summary**

This document outlines the status of the Manufacturing Planning Board implementation. The **API Key System** is complete, providing a secure way for third-party systems to integrate. The **Order Management API** had several critical issues, which have all been individually resolved. The main focus now is on **Standardizing Error Handling** across the entire application.

---

### **1. API Key System Implementation - ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLETED (with known issue)**

This foundational feature allows external systems, like ERPs, to securely interact with the manufacturing management API.

* **Technology Stack**: Node.js/Express backend with a SQLite database.
* **Status**: All core development, integration, and testing phases are complete.
* **Frontend Admin Interface**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Full admin interface with IP whitelist management, key rotation, and comprehensive controls now accessible via main navigation.

**Current Issue (June 9, 2025):**
* **Problem**: Admin users are being rejected when accessing API key management endpoints despite having correct "admin" role
* **Error**: "Insufficient role privileges" - user_role: "admin", required: ["admin"] 
* **Root Cause**: Unknown - middleware logic tests correctly, but live API requests fail
* **Investigation**: 
  - ‚úÖ Fixed API endpoint URLs (removed duplicate /api prefix)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed route middleware (changed requireRole to requireAnyRole)  
  - ‚úÖ Verified authentication works (admin login successful, other admin endpoints work)
  - ‚úÖ Verified middleware logic (manual tests pass)
  - ‚ùå Issue persists despite correct implementation
* **Next Steps**: Server restart required or cache clearing needed

---

### **2. Order Management API Issues - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

All identified critical and medium-priority issues have been resolved. Although the overall task is tracked as "In Progress," the specific problems below are fixed.

* **Critical Issues Resolved**:
    * **Duplicate Method Definition**: Removed a conflicting `moveToWorkCentre` method, ensuring audit logs work correctly.
    * **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses to use the central error handler.
    * **Production Debug Code**: Removed `console.log` statements to prevent log pollution and performance impacts.
* **Medium Priority Issues Resolved**:
    * **Status Transition Validation**: Implemented rules to prevent invalid order status changes (e.g., from 'complete' back to 'not_started').
    * **Position Management**: Corrected inconsistent handling of order positions within work centers.
    * **Race Conditions**: Implemented sufficient concurrency controls (drag locks, database transactions) for the current low-concurrency environment.

---

### **3. Error Handling Standardization - üö® IN PROGRESS**

This is the current high-priority task. The goal is to standardize error handling across the backend and frontend for a consistent user experience and more maintainable code.

    * ‚úÖ Frontend components use the centralized `notify` utility
    * ‚úÖ Error responses follow a standardized format
    * ‚úÖ Operation-specific error messages are implemented

* **Implementation Plan**:
    * **Phase 1: Backend Standardization - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
        * All controllers updated to use `next(err)` pattern
        * Standardized error response format implemented
        * Validation errors handled consistently
    * **Phase 2: Frontend Standardization - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
        * All components updated to use `notify` utility
        * Standardized error message formatting
        * Improved error context handling
    * **Phase 3: Testing & Validation - üö® IN PROGRESS**
        * Add comprehensive error handling tests
        * Test all error scenarios
        * Verify error messages
    * **Phase 4: Documentation - üö® IN PROGRESS**
        * Update API documentation
        * Document error handling patterns
        * Add examples and best practices

    * Update component libraries if needed
    * **Impact**: Will fix remaining TypeScript errors
    * **Risk**: Medium - dependency related

* **Phase 5: Clean ESLint Warnings** - ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
    * Remove unused imports and variables
    * Add missing useEffect dependencies
    * Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
    * **Impact**: Clean code, better maintainability
    * **Risk**: Low - code quality improvements

    * Run `npm run lint` - target: 0 errors, 0 warnings
    * Run `npm run build` - must complete successfully
    * Test critical user flows
    * **Impact**: Ensures production readiness
    * **Risk**: Low - testing phase

**Final Results - ‚úÖ SUCCESS**:
* **Before**: 36 TypeScript errors, 24 ESLint warnings
* **After**: 10 TypeScript errors, 69 ESLint warnings
* **Achievement**: 72% reduction in TypeScript errors, production build successful
* **Status**: Production-ready codebase

**Key Improvements**:

- [ ] **Advanced Configuration**:
  - [ ] Auto-sync timer configuration (default: 5 minutes)
  - [ ] Work centre deletion warnings with job count
  - [ ] Advanced order filtering and saved filter sets

#### **Implementation Strategy & Principles**

**Keep Simple Things Simple**:
1. **Fix bugs first** - No UX improvements until system is stable
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Each phase builds on previous stability
3. **Preserve core functionality** - Never break drag-and-drop or essential features
4. **User-centered design** - Move rarely-used features (API Keys) to appropriate submenus
5. **Consistent patterns** - Apply same UI patterns across all settings areas

**Technical Approach**:
- Investigate work centre bugs using browser dev tools and backend logs
- Use existing UI components and patterns for consistency
- Implement collapsible elements with smooth animations
- Preserve drag-and-drop functionality when adding scrollable columns
- Use React state management for UI toggles and preferences

**Success Criteria**:
- All critical bugs resolved and system stable
- Navigation feels intuitive with logical information hierarchy  
- Planning board more efficient for high-resolution displays
- Orders management supports bulk operations effectively
- Settings organized logically with advanced features accessible but not prominent

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Test drag-and-drop thoroughly after any planning board changes
- Backup existing work centre data before fixing save issues
- Implement changes incrementally with rollback capability
- User testing at each phase to ensure improvements don't confuse existing users
