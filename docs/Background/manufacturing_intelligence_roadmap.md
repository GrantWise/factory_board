# Manufacturing Intelligence Roadmap
## Predictive Analytics & OEE Integration Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The Manufacturing Planning Board's passive data collection creates a unique opportunity to build the industry's most practical predictive manufacturing system. By capturing real shop floor decisions and movements, we can develop statistical forecasting capabilities that surpass traditional OEE systems in both accuracy and usability. This document outlines the evolution from basic job tracking to intelligent manufacturing optimization.

---

## Strategic Vision

Transform shop floor chaos into predictable, optimized workflows through invisible data collection and progressive intelligence enhancement. Unlike complex finite capacity systems that fail due to data maintenance overhead, our approach learns from actual foreman decisions and real-world constraints to provide practical, actionable insights.

### Core Principle
**"Intelligence emerges from reality, not theory"**
- Capture actual behavior vs. planned behavior
- Learn from foreman expertise vs. impose theoretical constraints
- Evolve from simple visibility to predictive optimization
- Maintain human override at all stages

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Data Collection (Months 1-6)
*"Building the world's best shop floor database while users think they're just getting job visibility"*

### Automatic Data Capture
Every user interaction generates valuable intelligence:

```json
{
  "jobMovement": {
    "orderId": "MO-2024-001",
    "operation": "Turning",
    "partType": "Bracket",
    "quantity": 100,
    "fromWorkCentre": "QUEUE",
    "toWorkCentre": "LATHE-01",
    "movedBy": "foreman_john",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-01T08:30:00Z",
    "queueDepthBefore": 5,
    "queueDepthAfter": 6,
    "priority": "normal",
    "dueDate": "2024-06-03",
    "reason": "user_decision"
  }
}
```

### Learning Dimensions
- **Routing Patterns**: Which operations follow which routes under different conditions
- **Queue Dynamics**: How queue depths affect processing times and decisions
- **Priority Behaviors**: How urgent jobs flow differently through the system
- **Temporal Patterns**: Day-of-week, time-of-day, seasonal effects
- **Foreman Preferences**: Individual decision-making patterns and expertise
- **Part Complexity**: How different part types behave in the system

### Success Metrics
- Data capture rate: >95% of all job movements
- Pattern recognition: Identify 3+ statistically significant routing patterns
- Baseline establishment: 6 months of clean, consistent data

    # Machine learning model trained on historical data
    base_time = historical_average(work_centre, part_type)
    queue_factor = queue_depth_multiplier(current_queue_depth)
    temporal_factor = time_adjustment(day_of_week, time_of_day)
    
    predicted_time = base_time * queue_factor * temporal_factor
    confidence_interval = calculate_confidence(historical_variance)
    
    return predicted_time, confidence_interval
```
