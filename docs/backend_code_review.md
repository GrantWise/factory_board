# Backend Code Review Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the current state of the backend for the factory_board project, highlights strengths, identifies actionable improvements, and provides guidance for future extensibility. It is intended as a clear, actionable reference for the development team.

---

## What the Backend Does
- Provides a Node.js/Express REST API for manufacturing planning and operations.
- Supports authentication, role-based access control, and real-time updates via WebSocket.
- Manages users, work centres, manufacturing orders, steps, and analytics.
- Includes database schema for users, work centres, orders, steps, audit logs, and future integrations (scanner events, machine performance).

---

## Strengths
- **Comprehensive API design** covering core manufacturing operations.
- **Role-based access control** with clear permission mapping for admin, scheduler, and viewer roles.
- **Real-time support** for drag-and-drop and conflict prevention via WebSocket events.
- **Extensible schema** for future features (OEE, scanner events, machine data).
- **RESTful endpoint structure** with clear separation of concerns.

---

## Areas for Improvement
- **API Coverage:** Ensure all endpoints used by the frontend are present, documented, and follow consistent naming conventions.
- **Documentation:** Expand endpoint documentation with example requests, responses, and error cases. Document error codes and validation strategies.
- **Validation & Error Handling:** Implement a centralized error handler, standardize error codes, and ensure all user input is validated with clear error messages.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for all endpoints, especially those handling user input and backend logic. Test role-based access and permission enforcement.
- **Consistency:** Review all endpoints for consistent naming, HTTP methods, and RESTful conventions. Confirm all endpoints use the `/api/` prefix.

## API Mapping: Backend Support for Frontend

| Area         | All Endpoints Present? | Notes/Actions Needed                |
|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Auth         | Yes                   | -                                   |
| Orders       | Yes                   | -                                   |
| Work Centres | Yes                   | -                                   |
| Planning     | Yes                   | -                                   |
| Analytics    | Yes                   | Route names differ slightly         |
| WebSocket    | Yes                   | -                                   |

## Actionable TODOs
- [ ] Align frontend and backend route naming for analytics for clarity.
- [ ] Expand endpoint documentation with example requests, responses, and error cases.
- [ ] Document and standardize error codes for all endpoints.
- [ ] Implement a centralized error handling middleware (`errorHandler.js`).
- [ ] Refactor controllers to use `next(err)` for error propagation.
- [ ] Add logging for server errors in the error handler.
- [ ] Ensure all user input is validated on the backend with clear error messages.
- [ ] Add/expand comments explaining error handling strategy.
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for all endpoints, especially those handling user input and backend logic.
- [ ] Add tests for role-based access and permission enforcement.
- [ ] Review and update this document as improvements are made or new issues are discovered.

## Error Handling & Middleware Review
- Controllers use try/catch blocks and return JSON error responses with status codes and error codes.
- Validation middleware (Joi) provides structured validation errors.
- Auth and permissions middleware return clear error messages for authentication/authorization issues.
- No centralized error handling middleware is present; error responses are manually constructed in each controller.
- Error handling logic is duplicated across controllers and could be standardized.

---

## Extensibility Guidance
- Design new modules (controllers, routes, services) to be modular and reusable.
- Use clear, documented interfaces for middleware and services.
- When adding new endpoints or modules, follow the existing structure and document the process.
- Ensure all new modules are well-documented and follow the same validation, error handling, and testing standards.
- Consider API versioning for future changes.

## Notes
- This document is a living reference and should be updated as the project evolves.
- Next steps: Search backend codebase to confirm existence of endpoints for step management, machine management, analytics, and user profile/password updates.
